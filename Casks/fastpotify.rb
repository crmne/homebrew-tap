  caveats <<~EOS
    This build is not notarized yet, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Either clear the quarantine flag:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Fastpotify.app
    or open it once through System Settings, Privacy & Security: double-click
    the app, click Done, then scroll to the Security section and click
    "Open Anyway" next to the Fastpotify message. macOS remembers the choice.
